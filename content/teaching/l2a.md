#### *COURSE DESCRIPTION* ####
This course is a general introduction to scientific research into how people learn a second language. Although the course is designed to be accessible to students from a wide variety of backgrounds, some knowledge of the linguistic structure of English will be assumed.

Second language acquisition, or SLA, is a theoretical and experimental field of study which, like first language acquisition studies, looks at the phenomenon of language development -- in this case the acquisition of a second language. 

The dominant aim behind the research of this field is to extend our understanding of the complex processes and mechanisms that drive language acquisition. 

By virtue of the fact that language itself is complex, SLA has become a broadly-based field and it now involves:
- Examining how non-native language ability develops, stabilizes, and undergoes attrition (forgetting, loss)
- Carrying out an analysis and interpretation of all aspects of learner language with the help of current linguistic theory
- Developing theories that are specific to the field of SLA that aim to account for the many facets of non-native language and behavior
- Testing hypotheses to explain second language knowledge and behavior


#### *LEARNING OBJECTIVES* ####
By the end of the course, students should be able to:  
[1].	Identify major issues in current SLA research and theory  
[2].	Discuss problems and challenges in current research and theory  
[3].	Describe how the field developed historically, including major trends in research/theories, major figures    
[4].	Summarize the important studies and basic ideas of research studies  
[5].	Formulate questions about aspects of research articles and theories that you do not understand  
[6].	Analyze second language learner data from multiple perspectives  
[7].	Articulate your own stand on theories of SLA (develop your own theory) and describe the principles that will inform your future work in the field
