      <description>WAE192 COURSE DESCRIPTION The purpose of WAE 192 is to provide students with writing experiences designed to help them express ideas effectively in sentences, paragraphs, and essays. Students will develop writing skills with the use of the dictionary, practicing structures of written English, and learning to edit in preparation for advanced editing in WAE 194. To accomplish these goals, students work on expanding their English competence on the sentence level, expanding their vocabulary through reading and the use of the dictionary, developing strategies that promote independence in writing, and editing personal and peer writing.</description>
