COURSE DESCRIPTION This course is a general introduction to scientific research into how people learn a second language. Although the course is designed to be accessible to students from a wide variety of backgrounds, some knowledge of the linguistic structure of English will be assumed.
Second language acquisition, or SLA, is a theoretical and experimental field of study which, like first language acquisition studies, looks at the phenomenon of language development &amp;ndash; in this case the acquisition of a second language.</description>

      <description>WAE192 COURSE DESCRIPTION The purpose of WAE 192 is to provide students with writing experiences designed to help them express ideas effectively in sentences, paragraphs, and essays. Students will develop writing skills with the use of the dictionary, practicing structures of written English, and learning to edit in preparation for advanced editing in WAE 194. To accomplish these goals, students work on expanding their English competence on the sentence level, expanding their vocabulary through reading and the use of the dictionary, developing strategies that promote independence in writing, and editing personal and peer writing.</description>
